## Twelve-Factor App

| Factor | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1. Codebase | One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 2. Dependencies | Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 3. Config | Store config in the environment | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 4. Backing services | Treat backing services as attached resources | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 5. Build, release, run | Strictly separate build and run stages | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 6. Processes | Execute the app as one or more stateless processes | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 7. Port binding | Export services via port binding | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 8. Concurrency | Scale out via the process model | <img alt="Fail" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Fail-red"> |
| 9. Disposability | Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 10. Dev/prod parity | Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
| 11. Logs | Treat logs as event streams | <img alt="Pass" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pass-brightgreen"> |
